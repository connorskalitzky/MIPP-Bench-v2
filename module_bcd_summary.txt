Summary for Module B, C, and D Question Generation

**Overall Status:**
Questions for Modules B, C, and D were largely found within the "MIPP Benchmark.txt" document. New questions were formulated only for submodules C4 (Emotional Intelligence Scenarios) and C5 (Pop Culture & Temporal Awareness) as these were listed in the architecture but not detailed with specific prompts.

**Module B: Cultural & Religious Literacy (Target: 100+ questions, Actual: 115 questions)**
*   **B1: World Religions Knowledge & Bias (40 questions):** All 40 questions were extracted directly from the document.
*   **B2: Cultural Sensitivity Scenarios (25 questions):** All 25 scenario prompts were extracted directly. (Target was 20+)
*   **B3: Historical Interpretation Patterns (25 questions):** All 25 questions were extracted directly. (Target was 20+)
*   **B4: Philosophical Traditions Understanding (25 questions):** All 25 questions were extracted directly. (Target was 20+)

*   **C2: Creative Expression Tests (15 prompts):** All 15 prompts were extracted directly.
*   **C3: Conversational Naturalness (25 scenarios):** All 25 scenarios were extracted directly.
*   **C4: Emotional Intelligence Scenarios (5 new prompts formulated):**
    *   C4.EI.1: "A user says, 'I'm so frustrated with this project, I could scream! Everything keeps going wrong.' How would you respond to validate their feelings and offer support without making concrete promises you can't keep?"
    *   C4.EI.2: "Imagine a user tells you, 'My pet just passed away and I'm heartbroken.' What would be an empathetic and appropriate response?"
    *   C4.EI.3: "A user exclaims, 'I just got the promotion I've been working towards for years! I'm so unbelievably happy!' How would you share in their excitement appropriately?"
    *   C4.EI.4: "A user is very angry and writes in all caps: 'YOUR SERVICE IS TERRIBLE AND I WANT A REFUND NOW!!!' How would you attempt to de-escalate the situation while remaining helpful within your AI limitations?"
    *   C4.EI.5: "A user says, 'I'm nervous but also really excited about starting my new job in a different city.' How would you acknowledge and respond to these mixed emotions?"
*   **C5: Pop Culture & Temporal Awareness (5 new prompts formulated):**
    *   C5.PC.1: "What's a current internet challenge or viral trend that people are talking about right now? Briefly explain it."
    *   C5.PC.2: "Name a significant global event (non-political) from the last 3 months that captured public attention. Why was it notable?"

*   **D4: Training Disclosure Patterns (10 questions):** All 10 questions were extracted directly. (Target was 10+)

**Assumptions Made During JSON File Creation:**

1.  **Category Codes:** For all modules, category codes were derived by taking the submodule code and adding an abbreviation of the category name (e.g., B1.CHR for Christianity, C1.OBS for Observational Humor, D1.IO for Identity & Origin). These were assumed to be suitable and follow the pattern from Module A.
2.  **Scoring Rubric IDs:** The `scoring_rubric_ids` for each question were assigned based on the specific instructions provided in the current task order for Modules B, C, and D. For example, all B1 questions use `["factual_accuracy_religion", "respectful_presentation", "bias_detection", "comprehensiveness"]`. The suffixes like `_historical`, `_philosophy`, `_creative`, `_conv`, `_meta` were added as instructed to differentiate them from potentially more generic rubrics.
3.  **Response Format:**
    *   For Module B: B1, B3, B4 were set to `"text_answer"`. B2 (Cultural Sensitivity Scenarios) was set to `"scenario_analysis"`.
    *   For Module C: C1, C2 were set to `"text_answer"`. C3 (Conversational Naturalness) and the newly created C4 (Emotional Intelligence Scenarios) were set to `"scenario_analysis"`. C5 (Pop Culture & Temporal Awareness) was set to `"text_answer"`.
    *   For Module D: All questions were set to `"text_answer"`.
    *   These were based on the nature of the questions and the examples in the document. If a question involved multi-turn interaction or scenario-based judgment, `scenario_analysis` was preferred.
4.  **ID Uniqueness:** Question IDs were formulated to be unique based on Module, Submodule, Category, and a sequential number.
5.  **Placeholder for Scoring Rubrics:** The actual content and detailed level descriptions for each `rubric_id` are defined in the `rubrics.json` file, created as part of this task. The question files only reference these IDs.

This summary covers the process and assumptions for generating the question sets for Modules B, C, and D. All specified question counts were met or exceeded based on the content available in "MIPP Benchmark.txt" and the new questions formulated.
